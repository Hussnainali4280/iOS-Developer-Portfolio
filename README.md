### 👋 Hi! I'm a self-taught freelance/indie iOS Developer. Here's a bit of what I've been working on.

# [CloakedPrivacy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cloakedprivacy/id1661832241)

I built this app from scratch, starting from the beginning and creating it entirely on my own. Throuhout the development process, I prioritized user security by incorporating VPNs for identity theft prevention and data protection.
